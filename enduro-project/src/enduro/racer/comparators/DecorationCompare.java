 * Meaning that they can be combined and supplant each other, eg. if
 * one compare returns 0 then it falls back to a lesser important one until either
 * something other than 0 is obtained - or if the next fallback is null - in which case it returns 0.
 * 
 * Subclasses should implement a basic constructor in addition to the required one - sending null to the super constructor means "no fallback"
